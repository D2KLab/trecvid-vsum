7892,5542003749222140011.xml,1276,4265.04,4269.22,Exactly. Ugh.  I'm such a dork. She's so gorgeous.

10423,5544620672795594434.xml,145,505.2,507.1,Last night... 
10424,5544620672795594434.xml,146,507.11,510.09,"I don't know what I was thinking.  Well, I could give you  a pretty good idea!"

10446,5544620672795594434.xml,168,556.21,559.13,"I wouldn't say that exactly.  I wouldn't do anything to  hurt him, Pat. He's my husband."

10456,5544620672795594434.xml,178,588.08,589.1,Yes. Home and dry.

10480,5544620672795594434.xml,202,658.09,661.08,I had a nice time last night.  Yeah.
10481,5544620672795594434.xml,203,661.09,662.17,"Yeah, me too.  It was...unexpected."

10483,5544620672795594434.xml,205,664.07,669.09,Took you by surprise?  The best ones always do.  Come here. You've missed a bit.

10485,5544620672795594434.xml,207,674.17,677.03,But it can't happen again  right now. Oh?
10486,5544620672795594434.xml,208,677.04,680.13,"Second thoughts?  No, no, not at all."
10487,5544620672795594434.xml,209,680.14,683.2,"Just... Just a bit busy, that's all.  If you ever want to surprise me  again, just give me a call. Wouldn't be a surprise then!"
10488,5544620672795594434.xml,210,683.21,684.22,
10489,5544620672795594434.xml,211,684.23,689.1,Depends what happens next!

10495,5544620672795594434.xml,217,698.19,702.21,Be breaking your heart before  you know it. What are you up to?
10496,5544620672795594434.xml,218,702.22,705.13,Nothing. Just that my daughter... 
10497,5544620672795594434.xml,219,705.14,707.0,
10498,5544620672795594434.xml,220,707.01,709.21,"Quite a coincidence, isn't it.  This? Yes, it is. Did you arrange it?"
10499,5544620672795594434.xml,221,709.22,717.12,What?  You and Bushra. She must've known  who Afia's parents were. Did you arrange for Afia to  get to the wedding to meet Tamwar?
10500,5544620672795594434.xml,222,717.13,723.17,Do you know how ridiculous  that sounds? Answer me. Of course not.  I'm as shocked as you are.
10501,5544620672795594434.xml,223,723.18,726.06,I wish it hadn't happened.  Then why are you here? 
10502,5544620672795594434.xml,224,726.07,727.22,
10503,5544620672795594434.xml,225,727.23,729.16,Afia saw Tamwar this morning. 
10504,5544620672795594434.xml,226,729.17,731.22,And? 
10505,5544620672795594434.xml,227,731.23,739.16,He as good as told her  he can't see her again. Afia's very upset.  He's following his parents' wishes.  That is a good thing.
10506,5544620672795594434.xml,228,739.17,741.19,
10507,5544620672795594434.xml,229,741.2,746.19,"Not always, it isn't. "
10508,5544620672795594434.xml,230,746.2,750.13,What do you expect me to do about it?  Reconsider. 
10509,5544620672795594434.xml,231,750.14,763.09,"A terrible thing happened.  And we all carry  the scars to prove it. But now there's a chance that  something good can come out of this. All that pain and anguish, Zainab -  let's not pass it on.  Three lives is enough, isn't it? "
10510,5544620672795594434.xml,232,763.1,766.06,Let's end it. Now and forever. 
10511,5544620672795594434.xml,233,766.07,773.16,You're right. 
10512,5544620672795594434.xml,234,773.17,775.21,It must end. 
10513,5544620672795594434.xml,235,775.22,782.0,"Good.  And this is how we'll do it. You go, "
10514,5544620672795594434.xml,236,782.01,785.21,"you leave us alone,  and you pretend that  none of this ever happened."
10515,5544620672795594434.xml,237,785.22,789.09,And then you tell Afia that  it's your decision.
10516,5544620672795594434.xml,238,789.1,790.19,
10517,5544620672795594434.xml,239,790.2,793.02,She'll hate me.  You want to atone?
10518,5544620672795594434.xml,240,793.03,796.16,You take the blame.  This will never go away.
10519,5544620672795594434.xml,241,796.17,811.22,And I will not pretend.  What kind of life would  the two of them have with this hanging over them? It's three lives now.  I will not make it five.

10525,5544620672795594434.xml,247,818.09,820.2,I thought I made  myself clear. Masood...

10529,5544620672795594434.xml,251,822.21,823.1,Shut up. You let him in here?  It's not my fault. Not your...?
10530,5544620672795594434.xml,252,823.11,824.09,
10531,5544620672795594434.xml,253,824.1,825.15,

10534,5544620672795594434.xml,256,829.04,835.03,I wanted to try and convince you  to change your minds.
10535,5544620672795594434.xml,257,835.04,837.02,But I can see that I was wrong.

10537,5544620672795594434.xml,259,838.19,840.13,My family will respect your wishes. 
10538,5544620672795594434.xml,260,840.14,843.02,Just go.

11706,5547193787702629969.xml,869,2950.05,2966.24,When did you decide to leave me?  A few months ago.  What's going to happen  with the Paris trip?
11707,5547193787702629969.xml,870,2967.0,2976.11,I cancelled it.  You know that afternoon  when you were in Masood's

13866,5549784941472309008.xml,804,2453.14,2470.15,"Oh, no, dare me!  Go on, I love a dare. Anything. I did try and look for our son.  A few years ago, it was.  But you can only  go so far these days. And, um...  then they have to contact you."

13868,5549784941472309008.xml,806,2472.03,2473.08,"And as it turned out,  he didn't want to."

13870,5549784941472309008.xml,808,2474.2,2477.2,"Not that I can blame him, of course. "

13872,5549784941472309008.xml,810,2479.11,2486.18,"But I just really wanted  to know how he'd turned out. If he'd made something of himself.  You know, in spite of his start  in life, if he was happy."

13874,5549784941472309008.xml,812,2489.19,2499.02,"And then, a little while after the  adoption people told me that our son wasn't  interested in meeting me, then I got this job  in an office, cleaning"
13875,5549784941472309008.xml,813,2499.03,2501.2,"and, um, and Roger -  that's Mr Green, my boss -"
13876,5549784941472309008.xml,814,2501.21,2515.01,he just seemed really lovely.  The sort of son any mum  would be proud of. And that's when I decided... 
13877,5549784941472309008.xml,815,2515.02,2518.02,"To pretend he was your son.  Yeah, yeah."
13878,5549784941472309008.xml,816,2518.03,2544.04,"Only ever in my own little world.  In my scrap book, and that.  I never told him, of course.  But I'd just...I'd do little  things for him, you know? Like I'd get his dry cleaning  and...I'd bake him cakes. And I'd tidy his office  that little bit better than everyone else's, you know.  I'd just look after him.  The way any mum would her son. "

13883,5549784941472309008.xml,821,2571.13,2574.09,I needed something. Or someone. 
13884,5549784941472309008.xml,822,2574.1,2580.06,"And I should have stopped  it going so far, but I really, really didn't think  you'd actually go and visit him."
13885,5549784941472309008.xml,823,2580.07,2590.18,"Now you know all this,  can you forgive me?"

13887,5549784941472309008.xml,825,2592.16,2595.23,You sent him back out there  after he'd stuffed up. I didn't send him out there.
13888,5549784941472309008.xml,826,2595.24,2597.16,He wanted to go. Nothing I could've  said would've stopped him.

13891,5549784941472309008.xml,829,2602.07,2603.05,Jay's going to be all right.  I gave him a few pointers.
13892,5549784941472309008.xml,830,2603.06,2606.24,"And we know how well  that went, don't we? With Ben."
13893,5549784941472309008.xml,831,2607.0,2609.24,Where you going?  Out!

13895,5549784941472309008.xml,833,2612.18,2615.06,"Yeah, me, too, I suppose.  Eh?"
13896,5549784941472309008.xml,834,2615.07,2618.11,Alfie's asked me to work tonight. 
13897,5549784941472309008.xml,835,2618.12,2623.05,"Oh, right. Great. "

13899,5549784941472309008.xml,837,2625.0,2626.08,Although I'm not sure  it is actually candy.
13900,5549784941472309008.xml,838,2626.09,2631.0,Looks more like  a rattle or something. Are you not forgetting something?

But if you can lie to me about that,  well, then, how do I know you ain't  been lying about other stuff? Like what, exactly?  Like whether we actually had a son  in the first place. You don't think I'd lie  about something like that, do you? Fine, you believe what you want.  I know it might seem strange to you.  But y'know I done for me because I  needed it. And I didn't hurt anyone. Yeah, you did. "
13905,5549784941472309008.xml,843,2677.12,2684.06,You hurt me.

13910,5549784941472309008.xml,848,2694.08,2696.01,What you talkin' about?  The money that you short-changed me.
13911,5549784941472309008.xml,849,2696.02,2699.0,It was all there when I gave it  to you. You calling me a liar?
13912,5549784941472309008.xml,850,2699.01,2703.04,No. I'm saying that maybe  you made a genuine mistake and you'd like to put it right.
13913,5549784941472309008.xml,851,2703.05,2707.05,"Well, that's very considerate  of you. But I think I'll pass."

13916,5549784941472309008.xml,854,2711.0,2713.14,Especially after I tell him that it  was all there when I gave it to you.

Well, in that case I suppose I might  be able to let you have some. Seeing as you're in such need.  But the deal is 60/40. All right. But you've got to keep  this little arrangement low key. You can't go flashing it  around the square for people to see. Do you understand me? This stays between you and me.  So it is stolen, then?  Let's just say I ain't got any receipts. Is that a problem?  No. It's fine."

Well, I could be working here and the Vic then putting on a helmet to work down the mines all night and your  father would never notice. Anyway, did Whitney get you  something nice for your birthday? Yeah, she's giving it to me later.  She's great, isn't she?"
14299,5549784941472309008.xml,1237,3926.23,3930.22,"She certainly makes you smile.  I know Dad don't think  much of her, but you think she's all right, don't you?"

14369,5549784941472309008.xml,1307,4137.05,4139.07,To have a quick word with Stacey. 
14370,5549784941472309008.xml,1308,4139.08,4142.15,"Well, please can you do it later,  cos I need you to help me carry the tree. How about this one?"
14371,5549784941472309008.xml,1309,4142.16,4148.03,"Yeah, yeah, that one's good. OK.  Good."

14376,5549784941472309008.xml,1314,4157.03,4164.23,I know you like Janine.  But you're my sister and I need you on my side.
14377,5549784941472309008.xml,1315,4164.24,4175.15,Not that it's even about sides  but... Janine really loves you. Does Stacey?  I don't know about that. 
14378,5549784941472309008.xml,1316,4175.16,4179.22,She's got a picture of Bradley  by her bed.
14379,5549784941472309008.xml,1317,4179.23,4181.21,I know she likes me. 
14380,5549784941472309008.xml,1318,4181.22,4183.06,"Well, obviously... "
14381,5549784941472309008.xml,1319,4183.07,4187.05,"Well, who do you want to be with?  Her or Janine?"
14382,5549784941472309008.xml,1320,4187.06,4189.07,I don't know. 
14383,5549784941472309008.xml,1321,4189.08,4196.15,"Don't know much, do you?  Well, it's different, all right? When I'm with Janine it's about  living and day-to-day stuff."
14384,5549784941472309008.xml,1322,4196.16,4198.06,When I'm with Stacey it's fun. 
14385,5549784941472309008.xml,1323,4198.07,4201.02,It ain't all about fun.  Don't tell me what it's all about. You don't know the half of this.
14386,5549784941472309008.xml,1324,4201.03,4206.18,"Don't lecture me either, I know  you're only killing time with Pete."
14387,5549784941472309008.xml,1325,4206.19,4209.03,So?  So you're mucking him around like you're accusing me of mucking Janine around.
14388,5549784941472309008.xml,1326,4209.04,4210.15,
14389,5549784941472309008.xml,1327,4210.16,4211.2,"Yeah, I ain't made any promises,  have I? And I ain't marrying him."

14396,5549784941472309008.xml,1334,4248.18,4252.06,Christmas.  I think that's the second most  important thing about it.
14397,5549784941472309008.xml,1335,4252.07,4255.14,"The first, of course, being a  celebration of the birth of Jesus."
14398,5549784941472309008.xml,1336,4255.15,4260.05,Which was what started this all off. 
14399,5549784941472309008.xml,1337,4260.06,4264.0,Not that many people give  that a thought these days.
14400,5549784941472309008.xml,1338,4264.01,4266.17,You know the worst thing  is writing your cards
14401,5549784941472309008.xml,1339,4266.18,4268.11,
14402,5549784941472309008.xml,1340,4268.12,4270.17,and thinking of all the people  you sent them to last year that ain't here no more.
14403,5549784941472309008.xml,1341,4270.18,4277.02,Like Bradley. 
14404,5549784941472309008.xml,1342,4277.03,4282.16,"Yeah.  Still, Stacey's more cheerful.  She was in the laundrette  earlier on washing her smalls."
14405,5549784941472309008.xml,1343,4282.17,4288.03,"Apparently she's going away  for the weekend with a friend. That's good ain't it?  Yeah, well, bully for her."

14409,5549784941472309008.xml,1347,4296.01,4302.0,"Yeah, he was, when it suited him.  I'm just wondering what he'd do. "
14410,5549784941472309008.xml,1348,4302.01,4304.2,What Frank would do? 
14411,5549784941472309008.xml,1349,4304.21,4307.24,"D'you know, apparently young people  are wearing a bracelet with WWJD on it."

14413,5549784941472309008.xml,1351,4311.07,4313.2,What Would Jesus Do?  Apparently it's quite hip.
14414,5549784941472309008.xml,1352,4313.21,4315.2,
14415,5549784941472309008.xml,1353,4315.21,4319.09,WWFD? Somehow I don't  think that'd catch on.

14417,5549784941472309008.xml,1355,4322.21,4334.2,"You see, part of me thinks that he'd  tell me to keep me mouth shut... another part that he'd take  matters into his own hands, and yet somehow I can't help feeling  that he'd do the one thing that I really, really don't want to  do and that's pass the parcel."
14418,5549784941472309008.xml,1356,4334.21,4338.04,"Well, why don't you share it? "
14419,5549784941472309008.xml,1357,4338.05,4341.12,"You know,  with someone what's impartial."

14431,5549784941472309008.xml,1369,4385.21,4387.22,What? 
14432,5549784941472309008.xml,1370,4387.23,4391.18,Is it someone doing something  they shouldn't with someone they shouldn't be doing it with?
14433,5549784941472309008.xml,1371,4391.19,4394.01,"I mean, if you've got a dilemma,  Pat, that's probably what it is."
14434,5549784941472309008.xml,1372,4394.02,4403.17,"Actually it is.  And on second thoughts,  I think Frank would tell me  to mind me own business and let sleeping dogs lie."
14435,5549784941472309008.xml,1373,4403.18,4407.08,"Oh, do nothing? "
14436,5549784941472309008.xml,1374,4407.09,4412.14,"Well, that's typical of  the modern community."

14446,5549784941472309008.xml,1384,4438.14,4440.04,I hope she hurries up and hurts him  real soon.

14448,5549784941472309008.xml,1386,4442.06,4444.24,Because I don't want my son  going out with that skank. She is not a skank.

14452,5549784941472309008.xml,1390,4455.03,4458.22,"So when she breaks his heart  you'll just, what, gloat, will you?"
14453,5549784941472309008.xml,1391,4458.23,4461.0,"Well, according to you it's something  I'm good at."

14462,5549784941472309008.xml,1400,4492.0,4497.07,a one off then I think I'm  entitled to some change.
14463,5549784941472309008.xml,1401,4497.08,4501.08,Maybe we should include your  wife in this conversation.
