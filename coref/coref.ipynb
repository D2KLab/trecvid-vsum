       "['Kat persuades Stacey and Jean to come to R&R with her and Kim, leaving Charlie and Alfie to look after Lily. Alfie quickly escapes to the barrel store. There, Alfie fixes the new television to the wall, it falls off and smashes. Alfie joins the girls in R&R. Charlie has to pick up Mo and leaves Lily with Pat. Lily won’t settle so Pat takes her for a walk. Janine accuses Ryan of wanting to go to R&R because he knew Stacey would be there. Ryan denies it and leaves, Janine stays in the club. Julie explains that she was moved to another home when pregnant, their baby was taken away a week after she gave birth. Billy’s angry, first saying the baby should have stayed with them, then insisting Julie shouldn’t have told him about their son at all. Julie leaves, telling Billy he hasn’t changed. Carol ends up in R&R, Billy joins her. The pair get drunk together. Carol cries, Billy tries to kiss her. When Carol rejects his advances, Billy insults her. Billy then unsuccessfully propositions Jean. Stacey realises Billy’s upset her mum, Janine and Kat get drawn into their argument before Alfie steps in. Ricky takes Carol home, Bianca storms to R&R to confront Billy. Giving Lily to Ryan, Pat follows Bianca into the club, worried. Bianca shouts at Billy. When Bianca backs off, Billy says she’s just like all the other ‘scrubbers’ there. Billy then turns on Stacey, who hits him. Janine pulls out a chunk of Stacey’s hair. Kat and Janine hit each other. Billy staggers away from the fight. Someone puts their hand on Billy’s shoulder, he instinctively turns round and hits them - unfortunately it’s a policeman. Roxy’s jealous when Christian brings Syed to R&R. Christian’s furious when Roxy deliberately spikes Syed’s drink. ',\n",
       " 'Kim, Kat, Stacey, Pat and Janine are shut in a cell together. Stacey’s worried about Lily, and Pat admits she’s with Ryan, not Charlie. Stacey asks the police officer to phone Ryan. The girls play a game,\\xa0each saying something they’ve never done, to discover who else has done it. When Janine taunts Stacey, Stacey blurts out ‘I’ve never been engaged to a dirty old rapist’. Janine doesn’t believe it. Stacey quickly backtracks, then becomes distressed and when Pat gently asks if Archie raped her, she nods. Pat and Kat think this explains why Bradley killed Archie. Pat and Janine discuss Ryan, Stacey’s lies awake, listening. The next morning, the police let the women go with a caution. Billy and Alfie are locked in another cell. Billy talks about the horrors he experienced in care. An officer tells Billy they’re not going to press charges. Alfie’s frustrated when this doesn’t cheer Billy up. Billy has a panic attack and Alfie calmly talks him through it. Billy thanks Alfie and remembers Julie used to calm him down like that. Billy admits he always hated Alfie, especially when he was with Little Mo. He’s sure Alfie will always be better off than him, until Alfie admits Kat’s baby isn’t his. Billy assures Alfie the baby’s lucky to have him. Later, Billy calls Julie. Ryan’s terrified, he doesn’t know what to do with Lily. He asks Whitney to look after the baby, he can’t do it. Later, when Ryan’s out of the room, Whitney leaves. Ryan finds a note on Lily – ‘you can’. Anxious, after discovering there was no answer when the police called Ryan, Stacey and Janine rush home. They find Lily asleep with doting father Ryan lying next to her. Ryan tells them he doesn’t care what either of them say, he’s doing this. ',\n",
       " 'Ryan remains adamant that he wants to be a father to Lily, much to Janine’s displeasure. Ryan grows frustrated when his attempts to see Lily are thwarted by the Slaters. Feeling for Ryan, Janine decides to intervene. Having researched the official channels for Ryan to gain access to Lily, Janine presents her findings to a dismayed Stacey. With Ryan unwilling to back down, Stacey relents that he can be involved, provided he pays child maintenance. Ryan sets about finding another job in order to raise the maintenance funds. Having sought work at the Arches, Ryan returns to Stacey to visit Lily. Having witnessed Ryan and Stacey together with their daughter, Kat is convinced that Stacey fancies Ryan and that they should make a family. Stacey’s dismissive; she doesn’t want to wreck another marriage, but Kat deviously assures her that she’ll take care of it. With the deadline looming for paying the Vic rent, Alfie avoids Phil. He assures Kat that he has everything under control. Alfie decides to get involved in Jack’s poker night in an effort to raise funds. The game begins, with Jack, Alfie, Max and Patrick unimpressed when Roxy and Christian arrive to join in. With everyone else out of the game, Alfie and Roxy are left facing off. As the stakes get increasingly high with both parties putting in all their money, a quietly confident Alfie reveals his hand. He’s devastated when Roxy trumps him with a straight flush and pockets all the winnings. Unable to face Billy’s death, an increasingly fraught Carol begins to unravel. Taking out her anguish on the family, she brands Jim a racist. When Morgan spills ketchup on Billy’s jumper, Liam takes the blame. At breaking point, a furious Carol lashes out; hitting Liam across the head. ',\n",
       " 'With Liam sporting a cut on his head, Carol’s wracked with guilt for having struck him. She organises a family dinner in an effort to regain some normality, but as one by one the family cancel, Carol’s left despondent. Concerned for her mother, Bianca tries to impress upon everyone the importance of the meal. Carol’s touched when the family rally round her for the dinner. The atmosphere quickly changes when Bianca discovers the gash on Liam’s head. As Carol confesses, a horrified Bianca berates her. Carol bites back, blaming Bianca for Billy’s death and slamming everyone in turn for their part in it. They’re shocked as she reveals that they’re all banned from Billy’s funeral. Stacey agrees to let Ryan look after Lily, but is adamant she doesn’t want Janine involved. Janine attempts to play the role of adoring stepmother, but finds it a struggle to keep up the pretence. Ryan’s forced to leave Lily with Janine when he visits Phil for a job. Ryan manages to impress Phil by offering his skills in the car-nicking business. Discovering that Lily was left with Janine, a furious Stacey lambasts Ryan, but finds herself disarmed when he shows the effort he’s making to be responsible and provide. Billy’s bolstered when Julie helps on the stall and they make a great team. As they reminisce about their youths, talk turns to their son. Billy’s wistful about him, but Julie maintains that it should be left in the past. Alone later, Billy contacts the adoption agency in search of his son. With the Vic rent due, a panicked Alfie desperately tries to raise the funds. Having been unable to come up with the money, Alfie goes to face Phil. He’s stunned to discover that Roxy’s paid the rent for him as a goodwill gesture. ']"

There, Alfie fixes the new television to the wall, it falls off and smashes. Alfie joins the girls in R&R. Charlie has to pick up Mo and leaves Lily with Pat. Lily won’t settle so Pat takes her for a walk.\n",

    "Julie explains that she was moved to another home when pregnant, their baby was taken away a week after she gave birth. Billy’s angry, first saying the baby should have stayed with them, then insisting Julie shouldn’t have told him about their son at all. Julie leaves, telling Billy he hasn’t changed.\n",
    "Carol ends up in R&R, Billy joins her. The pair get drunk together. Carol cries, Billy tries to kiss her. When Carol rejects his advances, Billy insults her. Billy then unsuccessfully propositions Jean. Stacey realises Billy’s upset her mum, Janine and Kat get drawn into their argument before Alfie steps in. Ricky takes Carol home, Bianca storms to R&R to confront Billy. Giving Lily to Ryan, Pat follows Bianca into the club, worried. Bianca shouts at Billy. When Bianca backs off, Billy says she’s just like all the other ‘scrubbers’ there. Billy then turns on Stacey, who hits him. Janine pulls out a chunk of Stacey’s hair. Kat and Janine hit each other. Billy staggers away from the fight. Someone puts their hand on Billy’s shoulder, he instinctively turns round and hits them - unfortunately it’s a policeman. Roxy’s jealous when Christian brings Syed to R&R. Christian’s furious when Roxy deliberately spikes Syed’s drink.\"\"\""
